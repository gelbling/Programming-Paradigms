Compiling is taking code from one language and translating it into another. Transpiling is taking code from one language and
translating it to another language that has a similar level of abstraction.

We say CoffeeScript transpiles to JS because they have similar levels of abstraction and CoffeeScript code can also serve
as JS code.
