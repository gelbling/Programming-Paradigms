CoffeesSript: 

Variables a and b have global scopes becasue they are outside the function
a and b get overwritten with the values inside the function.

Variables d and e have local scopes because they are inside the function and nowhere else.


JavaScript:

Variable a has a global scope since it is initialized outside the function and initialized using var.

Variable c has a limited scope since it is initialized using let.

Variable a inside the function is local because it is declared inside.

Variable b has no scope since it isn't initialized anywhere.

Variables d and e both have local scopes since they are initialized inside the function.
