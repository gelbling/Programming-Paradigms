'Ryan' is printed on line 5 because the objects 'name' attribute is changed to
'Ryan' on line 3. 

'Irish' is printed on line 6 because the 'heritage' attribute 
isn't modified after the object is created using the prototype. Thus, 'Irish' is
printed because it is the default value assigned to the 'heritage' attribute in the 
object's prototype.

'undefined' is printed on line 7 because the object does not have an attribute
called 'height'. Thus, JS evaluates it as undefined.
