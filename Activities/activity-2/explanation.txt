The two variables firstName and lastName are empty, meaning that they
evaluate to a boolean false value. The next variable is nickName which, 
since it is not empty, evaluate to a boolean true value. Since all of 
these variables are being OR'd together, JS will print the first non 
false value which in this case is the nickName variable, thus outputing 
"JCSS".

In the second statement the firstName and lastName values are still
false and are OR'd together, thus making them meaninless. However, 
when doing an AND operation on nickName and 'Anonymous', which both
evaluate to true, 'Anonymous' will be outputted because AND operations
in JS always return the second (right) operand of the AND statement.
