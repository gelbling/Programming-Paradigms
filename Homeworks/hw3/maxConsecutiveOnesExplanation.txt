a) I found the bug through thinking through how the program ran through one of my failed test cases.

b) While doing the above, I realized that since the loop goes until the second to last list item,
   the program ends up ignoring the last value of the list which could be a one. Doing this, the
   program does not increment the counter if the last value of the list is a 1.

   The fix is to allow the loop to go through the entire array, 'nums.length' not 'nums.length - 1',
   allowing 'if(nums[i] === 1) count++;' to account for if the last element of the list is a 1. There also 
   needs to be a 'if (i != nums.length)' wrapping around the 'if(nums[i+1] === 0) count = 0;' in order to prevent
   JS from throwing an 'out of bounds' error. These two things fix the issue.
