The <script> element in HTML is used to embed executable code which would correspond to some action, this is usually JS.
The regular <script> tag without any attributes will pause the document parser, download the script, execute it, and then
continue the parsing of the reamining HTML.

The <script async> element with the 'async' attribute allows for the given script to be downloaded at the same time as 
the parsing of the webpage, thus executing the script as soon as possible. If the script is downloaded completely,
the webpage parsing will he halted, the script will be executed, and then the parsing of the page will continue.
This attribute is only usable for external scripts.

The <script defer> element with the 'defer' attribute signals to the browser to download the script in parallel to the HTML, but
but only execute it once the HTML is completely processed and the DOM is built.
This attribute is only usable for external scripts.

The major difference between these three are when each script is downloaded and executed.
