It is generally good practice to include JS right before the end of the body element is due to
the reason that whenever a browser encounters a script tag, it downalods and executes it on the spot/
If this were to be added to the top of the page, there would be a notable drop in rendering speed and 
user experience. In addition to this, if the DOM isn't fully created at the execution time of the script, 
JS wouldn't be able to manipulate elements accordingly.

On the other hand, it is generally good practice to include CSS linking in between the head element
because CSS gets rendered regardless of if the DOM is already created or not. This leads to the page 
being pretty and customized as soon as the page loads.
