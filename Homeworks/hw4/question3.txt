The code in the function print1() works as opposed to the function print2() simply because of
their usage of the arrows when defining the function (-> vs =>). The usage of -> in the causes
a TypeError in the 'innerFn'. This due to the fact that functions defined with -> assigns
the value of the current variable 'this' to the receiver. This error can easily be avoided by 
switching the -> in the print2() innerFn function to =>. This is because the => function definition
does not assign the value of the current variable 'this' to the receiver.

The print1() function works perfectly fine because it uses -> on the outside and uses => for 
defining the inside function, not the other way around as done erroniously inside and outside
of the print2() function.
