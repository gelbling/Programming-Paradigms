Definition: 
    Array comprehension in CoffeeScript is a way to replace for loops and make you code cleaner and more concise.
    With comprehension it is possible to create a new array, through applying some function/method to thew desired
    array elements.

Example Description:
    An example of the usage of list comprehension is if you want to separate professional CSGO (Counter Strike Global Offensive
    the biggest competitive first person shooter PC game) players according to their kills in a specific match. List comprehension
    is extremely useful in this case as it is an efficient and clean way of implementing such a funcitonality. This funcitonality
    can also be expanded to separate, players in this case, by any given attribute or characteristic. In this particular
    example, I will be creating a new array with player's gamer tags in which the player has more than 35 kills. Blow is an example of this
    funcitonality is CoffeeScript.

Example Code:

# array that stores player statistics objects objects
# adr = average death rate
playerStats = [

    {gamerTag: 'KSCERATO', kills: 55, deaths: 28, adr: 99.8, rating: 1.64}
    {gamerTag: 'saffee', kills: 41, deaths: 30, adr: 73.3, rating: 1.27}
    {gamerTag: 'yurrih', kills: 38, deaths: 33, adr: 78.2, rating: 1.11}
    {gamerTag: 'arT', kills: 34, deaths: 38, adr: 79.6, rating: 1.09}
    {gamerTag: 'drop', kills: 30, deaths: 33, adr: 70.9, rating: 0.91}

]

# create a variable to store the player's gamer tags that have more than 35 kills
mostKills = (player.gamerTag for player in playerStats when player.kills > 35)

# display the array of the players with most kills
console.log mostKills
